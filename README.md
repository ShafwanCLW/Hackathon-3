Hostpital Bill Generator 2.0

The hospital bill consists of total of patient’s charges which includes
hospital stay, surgery charges, pharmacy charges and other services charges. Firstly, the user
needs to input patient’s details and get number of days patient stay at the hospital. The user
needs to choose types of hospital stay, surgery, medication and service that have been used by
the patient from the table that display by the program. The program will calculate the total
charges for each patient and generate charges for each category. For hospital stay, the program
will get the number of days that the patient spent in the hospital from the user and calculate
prices based on room types and food charges. As this upgraded hospital billing system is for many
patients, the program will calculate the total charges for all patients and the total charges for
each category (hospital stay, surgery, medication, service) for all patients. Next, the program will
calculate average hospital stay for a patient. Based on the patient’s name that entered by the
user and total charges for each patient that has been calculated by the program, the program
should be able to find the patient’s name that pays the highest bill and the lowest bill. At the end
of this program, this program will print out each category charges for each patient, total charges
for each patient, total charges for all patients, total charges for each category for all patients,
average hospital stay for a patient, and patient’s name that pays the highest and lowest bill.
